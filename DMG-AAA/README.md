# DMG-AAA

This board is a repair board based on the DMG-AAA-02. The DMG-AAA is used by Catrap, Dr. Mario, and most versions of Tetris.

This board does not feature a MBC at all, and only has a ROM chip.

The original featured cut holes that were used for debugging or reference purposes, these have been mostly preserved.

This board was designed to closely replicate the footprints and routes used by the original cartridge board.

## Components

This board features a 44-pin ROM.
